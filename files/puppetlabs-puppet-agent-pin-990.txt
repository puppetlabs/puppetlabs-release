# Ubuntu 16.10 shipped with a puppet-agent package that was versioned based
# on the included version of puppet. This means the distro package would
# override Puppet Inc's puppet-agent AIO package version. We are working
# around this by pinning our puppet-agent package to a higher priority in
# this preferences config fragment:
Package: puppet-agent
Pin: origin "apt.puppetlabs.com"
Pin-Priority: 990
