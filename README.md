puppetlabs-release
==================

Repo for yum and apt release packages with Puppet's signing key.

See "Build and Ship a Release Package" in Confluence
(https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=159652513)
for details.

NOTE: We must now set the project using the `PROJECT_OVERRIDE` environment
variable when performing tasks with the packaging repo.
